WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.</p>\n",

    "Irish_water_spaniel is the most popular breed currently. Good news is there is increasing trend for the dog ratings and this can be considered as that people are getting used to love dogs more. However, this is just an insight. There might be other factors such as increased number of tweeter users or people are getting to spend more time in twitter etc.<br>\n",

    "Based on the data derived from the WeRateDogs tweeter account, people who retweet a dog also make it his/her favorite likely. \n",
    "However, no significant correlation found between ratings and number of favorites (and between ratings and number of retweets as well!). It seem odd initially because intuitevely we might expect that most favorited and/or most retweeted dogs should also have high ratings. However it is not impossible. Think about it, in almost every social media platform (such as twitter, instagram and facebook) there are 'haters'! And these people are tend to give dislikes, low ratings etc. however for some reason they might retweet the tweets as well for example to say \"see this ugly dog\"! However, they are just 'haters'! The fact that 'they're all good dogs :)'.<br>\n",

    "Interestingly, there are much more male gender dogs than female gender dogs. Most probably they are easy to take care however it's just a guess, there is no knowledge derived from the given datasets."
