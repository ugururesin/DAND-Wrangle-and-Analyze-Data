    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Project Introduction</b>: The dataset which is going to be wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.</p>"
